# TSSigner

The *`TSS`*(**Threshold Signature Scheme**) network is a key building block intended to perform Bitcoin signing in the distributed manner to facilitate the Bitcoin bridge on the [Bitway](https://github.com/bitwaylabs/bitway)

The TSS signature network consists of twenty-one nodes which are a subset of the Bitway validators of well-known reputation.

TSS nodes are mainly responsible for several tasks: *`DKG`*(**Distributed Key Generation**), `Signing` and `Relaying`.

## DKG

The DKG procedure is as follows:

1. Initiate: The DKG initiation is proposed as a governance proposal on the Bitway. The proposal contains the DKG participant set and required  threshold for later signing.

2. Vote: Community members and validators can vote for the proposal.

3. Create: The DKG request is formally created on the Bitway when the proposal passed.

4. Complete: TSS nodes will coordinate to complete the DKG request. All participants listed in the proposal must be connected to the TSS network in the phase.

5. Re-DKG: This happen when some nodes want to quit the TSS network according to their operation demands. New signing keys will be generated by the steps above and all assets held by the previous keys will be transferred to the newly generated ones.

## Signing

Signing is the regular task for TSS nodes.

1. Signing requests are fetched from the Bitway by the TSS node periodically.

2. Sign the requests and broadcast the related messages when signing requests are received.

## Relaying

As the security guard, TSS nodes can contribute to the security of the bitcoin bridge by relaying the bitcoin block headers.

At the same time, the bridge related transactions including deposit and withdrawal can be relayed to the Bitway by TSS nodes as well.

## Get started

### Build from source

1. Install *Rust*

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

2. Clone and build

```
git clone https://github.com/bitwaylabs/shuttler.git
cd shuttler
git checkout v2.0.0-rc2
cargo build --release
```

The binary can be placed into the bin directory of Cargo for convenience.

```
cp target/release/shuttler ~/.cargo/bin
```

### Configure

#### 1. Initialize
*** Notes ***  
```
shuttler --home ~/.shuttler init
```
The *home* directory can be replaced by your choice.  
You can specify the port by `--port`. The default port is `5158`.

#### 2. Set the bootstrapping nodes

```sh
vi ~/.shuttler/config.toml
bootstrap_nodes = ["<peer address>",...,"<peer address>"]
```

The bootstrapping nodes are used to help connect to the TSS network when started.
The format of the peer address is like this:
```
/ip4/<IP>/tcp/<PORT>/p2p/<PEER ID>
```

Your `peer id` can be retrieved as the following command:
```
shuttler --home <home> address
```
Please share your node address in the private channel so others can add you. and make sure to add at least 3 bootstrap nodes in your Shuttler config.

The seed node provided by Bitway Labs is as following:
```
[To be added]
```

#### 3. Set the Bitway gRPC
```
[bitway]
grpc = "<gprc address>"
```
If you run own Bitway node on the same server, the item can be set to `http://localhost:9090`. The value can be configured by the actual deployment or set to the public Bitway node which provides the gRPC server.

#### 4. Set the Bitcoin RPC
```
[bitcoin]
network = "<network name>"
rpc = "<rpc endpoint>"
user = "<rpc username>"
password = "<rpc password>"
```

For signers and relayers, the bitcoin node rpc is required to send the signed transactions or sync the bitcoin block headers and the bridge related transactions to the Bitway.
The TSS node operator can deploy own bitcoin node or use the third-party server provider by demand.
The public bitcoin node information provided by Bitway Labs is as follows:
```
network = "bitcoin"
rpc = "http://192.248.180.245:8332"
user = "bitway"
password = "12345678"
```
**_Note_**: The `--txindex` is required to be set when starting the Bitcoin node as following:

```
bitcoind -txindex -rpcuser=<user> --rpcpassword=<password>
```

### Fund the relayer address
The relayer(Bitway transaction sender) address can be viewed by the following command:
```
shuttler --home <home> address
```
**Note**: Before starting the TSS node, the relayer address needs to be funded for sending the transactions to the Bitway.

### Start TSSigner

*** Notes ***  
Start TSS:
```
shuttler --home <home> start --bridge --lending
```
