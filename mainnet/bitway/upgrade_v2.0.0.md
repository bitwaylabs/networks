# Bitway Upgrade Announcement (Mainnet)

## Notice

Because our bitway-1 chain forked at the first block, we tried to restore the chain, but it was very difficult. So we decided to stop bitway-1 and restart a new chain with chainId 'bitway'.  
Please follow the steps below:  

 1. Stop the chain bitway-1.
 2. Re-download the genesis.json file with chainId 'bitway'.
 3. Reset the node and restart it.
