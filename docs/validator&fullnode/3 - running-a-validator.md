# How to run a validator of BITWAY blockchain

## What is a Validator?
Validators are responsible for committing new blocks to the blockchain through an automated voting process. A validator's stake is slashed if they become unavailable or sign blocks at the same height. Because there is a chance of slashing, we suggest you read about Sentry Node Architecture to protect your node from DDOS attacks and to ensure high-availability.

The following instructions assume you have already set up a full-node and are synchonised to the latest blockheight.

## Whatâ€™s the Difference Between Bitway Validators and Validators on Other Cosmos-Based Blockchains?

Bitway validators have distinctive responsibilities compared to validators on typical Cosmos-based blockchains. In addition to standard block validation tasks, Bitway validators also perform oracle services. This includes:

- **Aggregating Bitcoin Prices:** Validators collect real-time Bitcoin prices from leading exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, Bitget, and OKEX. These prices are aggregated using a weighted average algorithm to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **Maintaining a Bitcoin Light Client:** Validators are required to synchronize Bitcoin block headers from a Bitcoin full node. This process ensures that an embedded Bitcoin light client on the Bitway remains up-to-date and secure.

### Additional Requirements

Before operating a Bitway validator node, you must:

- **Check Network Latency:** Evaluate the network latency between your validator node and the WebSocket endpoints of the supported exchanges. Low latency is crucial for timely and accurate price aggregation.
  
| Exchange | Websocket Endpoint |
|-----|----|
|Binance|wss://stream.binance.com:443/stream?streams=btcusdt@miniTicker/atomusdt@miniTicker|
|Bybit|wss://stream.bybit.com/v5/public/spot|
|Coinbase|wss://ws-feed.exchange.coinbase.com|
|Bitget | wss://ws.bitget.com/v2/ws/public|
|OKEX | wss://ws.okx.com:8443/ws/v5/public |
- **Run a Bitcoin Light Client:** Set up and maintain a Bitcoin Light Client. This is necessary to fetch and synchronize Bitcoin block headers for the embedded light client. [Installation](https://github.com/bitwaylabs/networks/docs/validator%26fullnode/2.1%20Running%20bitcoin%20light%20client.md)
  

**In summary**, Bitway validators not only secure the blockchain as traditional validators do, but also play a key role in bridging data from external sources and maintaining connectivity with the Bitcoin network.The latency between exchanges and Bitcoin full node will affect your uptime and may lead to your validator being jailed.


## Enabling the Oracle Module for Validator Nodes

***Before creating a validator, you must first enable the oracle module.***

To enable the oracle functionality, open your `app.toml` file and locate the `[oracle]` section. This section contains parameters required for nodes to query data from a Bitcoin client.

Set the following configuration:

```toml
[oracle]
# Set to true if this node will act as a validator. For non-validator (full) nodes, set to false.
enable = true

# The RPC endpoint of your Bitcoin full node.
bitcoin_rpc = "http://127.0.0.1:8332"
# The username for authenticating with your Bitcoin full node.
bitcoin_rpc_user = "your_rpc_username"
# The password for authenticating with your Bitcoin full node.
bitcoin_rpc_password = "your_rpc_password"
# Enable HTTP POST mode for Bitcoin RPC (usually should be true).
http_post_mode = true
# Disable TLS for local connections (set to false if using TLS).
disable_tls = true
```

> **Note:**  
> Setting `enable = true` allows your node to perform oracle duties and connect to a Bitcoin client. This is required for validator nodes participating in oracle services.

## Creating Your Validator

### Get some Bitway tokens from faucet

-  https://testnet.ping.pub/bitway/faucet

### check your balances:
```shell
$ bitwayd query bank balances bitway162ttnnflhvuazp42vxu5jf3fgxy750lrn3zrld
balances:
- amount: "999999900000000000"
  denom: ubtw
  pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

### Create Your Validator

```sh
bitwayd tx staking create-validator \
--from=alice \
--amount=400000000ubtw \
--pubkey=$(bitwayd tendermint show-validator)  \
--moniker="my_validator" \
--security-contact="contact@bitway.com" \
--chain-id="bitway-1" \
--commission-rate="0.1" \
--commission-max-rate="0.2" \
--commission-max-change-rate="0.05" \
--min-self-delegation="400000000" \
```

If you need further explanation for each of these command flags:

 - the `from` flag is the KEY_NAME you created when initializing the key on your keyring
 - the `amount` flag is the amount you will place in your own validator in ubtw
 - the `pubkey` is the validator public key found earlier
 - the `moniker` is a human-readable name you choose for your validator
 - the `security-contact` is an email your delegates are able to contact you at
 - the `chain-id` is whatever chain-id you are working with
 - the `commission-rate` is the rate you will charge your delegates
 - the `commission-max-rate` is the most you are allowed to charge your delegates
 - the `commission-max-change-rate` is how much you can increase your commission rate in a 24 hour period
 - the `min-self-delegation` is the lowest amount of personal funds the validator is required to have in their own validator to stay bonded 
 - the `gas-prices` is the amount of gas used to send this create-validator transaction

## Editing Validator Description

You can edit your validator's public description. This info is to identify your validator, and will be relied on by delegators to decide which validators to stake to. Make sure to provide input for every flag below. If a flag is not included in the command the field will default to empty (`--moniker` defaults to the machine name) if the field has never been set or remain the same if it has been set in the past.

The `<key_name>` specifies which validator you are editing. If you choose to not include some flags below, remember that the `--from` flag must be included to identify the validator to update.

The `--identity` can be used as to verify identity with systems like Keybase or UPort. When using Keybase, `--identity` should be populated with a 16-digit string that is generated with a keybase.io (opens new window)account. It's a cryptographically secure method of verifying your identity across multiple online networks. The Keybase API allows us to retrieve your Keybase avatar. This is how you can add a logo to your validator profile.

```shell
bitwayd tx staking edit-validator
  --moniker="choose a moniker" \
  --website="https://www.bitway.com" \
  --identity=6A0D65E29A4CBC8E \
  --details="To infinity and beyond!" \
  --chain-id="bitway-1" \
  --gas="auto" \
  --gas-prices="0.0025ubtw" \
  --from=<key_name> \
  --commission-rate="0.10"
```

**Note**: The `commission-rate` value must adhere to the following rules:

 - Must be between 0 and the validator's `commission-max-rate`
 - Must not exceed the validator's `commission-max-change-rate` which is maximum % point change rate per day. In other words, a validator can only change its commission once per day and within `commission-max-change-rate` bounds.

## Viewing Validator Description

View the validator's information with this command:

```shell
bitwayd query slashing signing-info <validator-pubkey> --chain-id="bitway-1"
```

## Unjail Validator
When a validator is "jailed" for downtime, you must submit an Unjail transaction from the operator account in order to be able to get block proposer rewards again (depends on the zone fee distribution).

```shell
bitwayd tx slashing unjail \
 --from=<key_name> \
 --chain-id=<chain_id>
```

## Confirm Your Validator is Running

Your validator is active if the following command returns anything:

```shell
bitwayd query tendermint-validator-set | grep "$(bitwayd tendermint show-address)"
```

You should now see your validator in one of blockchain explorers. You are looking for the bech32 encoded address in the `~/.bitway/config/priv_validator.json` file.

## Halting Your Validator
When attempting to perform routine maintenance or planning for an upcoming coordinated upgrade, it can be useful to have your validator systematically and gracefully halt. You can achieve this by either setting the `halt-height` to the height at which you want your node to shutdown or by passing the `--halt-height` flag to bitwayd. The node will shutdown with a zero exit code at that given height after committing the block.

## Advanced configuration
You can find more advanced information about running a node or a validator on the [CometBFT Core documentation](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.34/core/validators).
