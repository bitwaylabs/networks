# What's Cosmovisor

`cosmovisor` is a process manager for Cosmos SDK application binaries that monitors the governance module for incoming chain upgrade proposals. If it sees a proposal that gets approved, `cosmovisor` can automatically download the new binary, stop the current binary, switch from the old binary to the new one, and finally restart the node with the new binary.

# Setup
## Installation

1. Downloading the Binary:
    
You can download Cosmovisor from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/cosmovisor%2Fv1.5.0).

2. Using `go install`

To install the latest version of cosmovisor, run the following command:
```shell
go install cosmossdk.io/tools/cosmovisor/cmd/cosmovisor@latest
```
To install a specific version, you can specify the version:
```shell
go install cosmossdk.io/tools/cosmovisor/cmd/cosmovisor@v1.5.0
```

## Setting up environmental variables

`cosmovisor` relies on the following environmental variables to work properly:

 - `DAEMON_HOME` is the location where upgrade binaries should be kept (e.g. $HOME/.bitway).
 - `DAEMON_NAME` is the name of the binary itself (eg. bitwayd).
 - `DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES` (optional, default = false) if set to true will enable auto-downloading of new binaries (for security reasons, this is intended for full nodes rather than validators).
 - `DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE` (optional, default = true) if set to true it will restart the sub-process with the same command line arguments and flags (but new binary) after a successful upgrade. By default, cosmovisor dies afterwards and allows the supervisor to restart it if needed. Note that this will not auto-restart the child if there was an error.
 - `DAEMON_POLL_INTERVAL` (optional, default = 300ms) is the interval length for polling the upgrade plan file. The value can either be a number (in milliseconds) or a duration (e.g. 1s).
 - `UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP` (optional, default = false), if set to true, upgrades directly without performing a backup. Otherwise (false) backs up the data before trying the upgrade. The default value of false is useful and recommended in case of failures and when a backup needed to rollback. We recommend using the default backup option `UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=false`.

To set these variables correctly, we recommend editing the `~/.profile` file so that they are loaded when you log into your machine. You can use the following command:

```shell
nano ~/.profile
```

We recommend that you configure the following values:

```shell
export DAEMON_HOME=$HOME/.bitway
export DAEMON_NAME=bitwayd
export DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=true
export DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true
export UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true
```

After making the necessary changes, press `Ctrl+O` to save the file and then `Ctrl+X` to exit the editor. To apply the changes, reload the `~/.profile` file by running:

```shell
source ~/.profile
```
You can confirm the values that have been set by executing the following command:





```shell
echo $DAEMON_NAME
```
If the output of this command is `bitwayd` then you're all set to proceed.

## Setting up folder structure

Cosmovisor expects a certain folder structure:
```shell
.
├── current -> genesis or upgrades/<name>
├── genesis
│   └── bin
│       └── $DAEMON_NAME
└── upgrades
    └── <name>
        └── bin
            └── $DAEMON_NAME
```
You don't need to be concerned about the `current` folder as it's merely a symbolic link utilized by Cosmovisor. However, the other directories will require configuration, but this process is straightforward:
```shell
mkdir -p $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/genesis/bin && mkdir -p $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades
```

## Copy `bitwayd` to the genesis folder.

```shell
cp $HOME/go/bin/bitwayd $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/genesis/bin
```

You can verify this by running the following command (you should see the version of `bitwayd`):

```shell
cosmovisor version
```

## Starting your node
```shell
cosmovisor run start
```

## Setup Service
First, create the service file:
```shell
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/bitwayd.service
```
Insert the following content into the `bitwayd.service` file.

```shell
[Unit]
Description=BITWAY Blockchain Daemon (cosmovisor)
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=ubuntu
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/cosmovisor run start
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096
Environment="DAEMON_NAME=bitwayd"
Environment="DAEMON_HOME=$HOME/.bitway"
Environment="DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=false"
Environment="DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true"
Environment="DAEMON_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE=512"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
> **Note**: We assume you are using the "ubuntu" user. If you prefer to use a different user, please replace "ubuntu" with your desired username.

Secondly, copy `cosmovisor` to `/usr/local/bin`,
```shell
sudo cp ~/go/bin/cosmovisor /usr/local/bin
```

Finally, enable the service and start it.
```shell
sudo -S systemctl daemon-reload
sudo -S systemctl enable bitwayd
# check config one last time before starting!
sudo systemctl start bitwayd
```
